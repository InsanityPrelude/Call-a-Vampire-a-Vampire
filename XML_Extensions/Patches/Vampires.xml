                <description>{vampireUpper}s are a type of archotech-enhanced xenohuman. Powered by archites, their abilities go far beyond normal genetic enhancements. They are mentally adept and supernaturally beautiful. In combat, they can launch deadly spines and heal injured friends. They don't age or die naturally and never suffer from disease or poison. A {vampireLower} can make a new {vampireLower} by reimplanting their own xenogerm into a person.\n\n{vampireUpper}s must regularly consume human blood, and they must periodically enter torpor for long periods. They're easily destroyed by fire, and slowed down by UV light.\n\nThe first {vampireLower} appeared thousands of years ago when the lord-explorer Varan-Dur sought to control a hyperintelligent archotech and found himself transformed by it instead. Every {vampireLower} is descended from him. Since then, {vampireLower}s have often been hunted because of their destabilizing power and their need for blood. Since they can pass for baseliners, many live in hiding among typical humans.\n\nTheir numbers are unknown. Some think they are legends or rare irrelevancies. Some believe {vampireLower}s secretly direct entire human civilizations. The stories speak of eternal lords ruling billions from slate-black space stations, or directing blood sacrifices at conferences in the underlayers of the deepest urbworlds.</description>
