  <Hemogen>blood</Hemogen>
  <HemogenDesc>Blood is a biological energy source extracted from humans. Baseliner humans produce it endogenously and consume it over time in their own internal balance. Some human xenotypes use it as a kind of fuel for specific abilities, while others must consume it to survive at all.</HemogenDesc>
  <DeathrestCapacity>torpor capacity</DeathrestCapacity>
  <DeathrestCapacityDesc>This determines how many torpor buildings a person can connect to while in torpor. Each torpor building confers a specific benefit, so it's better to be able to connect to more of them.\n\nTorpor capacity can be increased using torpor capacity serums. These serums can be purchased from traders.</DeathrestCapacityDesc>
